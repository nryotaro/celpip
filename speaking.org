There are two grocery stores in our town. The first one is Target, and the second one is Sakura Mart.
I suggest you go to the Target. The main reason is that you can buy tasty and inexpensive foods there.
They are not only delicious but also healthy because most of them are organic foods.
There are many sellers, and they are helpful. They are willing to help you if you cannot find what you want to buy.
If you live near the Target, you should go there.
On the other hand, Sakura Mart is a small grocery store.
The prices of Sakura Mart's products are comparatively higher than the prices of Target.
The staff members look busy, and you cannot expect them to help you.
They don't arrange products well. It takes time to find the products that you are looking for.

**** 修正答案
I think social media should require users to verify their real identity.

I have a couple of reasons.

As other people cannot identify them by their names, they may post offensive content.
If offensive content causes trouble, what they have to do is just create a new account.
Allowing anonymous users may not benefit social platforms.

Secondly, making users' identities disclosed to public can motivate users to post meaningful content.
By posting good messages with their own names, they become popular and are recognized.
Good content can make the platform more popular as well.

Third, users can use others' identities when posting content on social media. If social media doesn't require clarification of user identities, then anyone can use others' identities when posting content on it.
