There are two grocery stores in our town. The first one is Target, and the second one is Sakura Mart.
I suggest you go to the Target. The main reason is that you can buy tasty and inexpensive foods there.
They are not only delicious but also healthy because most of them are organic foods.
There are many sellers, and they are helpful. They are willing to help you if you cannot find what you want to buy.
If you live near the Target, you should go there.
On the other hand, Sakura Mart is a small grocery store.
The prices of Sakura Mart's products are comparatively higher than the prices of Target.
The staff members look busy, and you cannot expect them to help you.
They don't arrange products well. It takes time to find the products that you are looking for.
